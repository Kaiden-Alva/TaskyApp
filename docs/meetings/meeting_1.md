## Risk Management

### Identified Risks & Mitigation Strategies

1. **Missing Deadlines**

   - **Mitigation**: Maintain proper communication channels, adhere to established timeline, implement task tracking and sprints, encourage team members to ask for help when needed

2. **Scope Creep**

   - **Mitigation**: Regularly review project requirements, make feature decisions as a team, prioritize core functionality over nice-to-have features, maintain clear communication about project boundaries

3. **Incomplete Requirements Planning**
   - **Mitigation**: Follow established task priorities, maintain proper user stories and acceptance criteria, ensure team understanding of requirements before implementation begins
