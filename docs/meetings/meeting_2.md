2:30 pm - started the meeting by refining out backlog and turning our objectives into user stories.  Porter, Corbin, and Ethan all created stories from 4 user issues, and Ethan updated the product backlog.

We decided that we want to meet sometime at the end of this week, likely on Saturday afternoon.  Time tbd.

Tools: We decided that we want to use Python for creating the backend, React/Javascript for our frontent, and Fast API for our API.  We also want to use SQL alchemy to abstract our SQL and make it easier to work with.

Assignments to complete this milestone: Complete the SRS fully, complete use case diagram, complete UML class diagrams, complete MVP
Corbin and Kaiden completed most of the SRS, and we discussed that we need to meet at another point this week to discuss assignments and creating the MVP.  We decided on Thursday the 2nd of October at 4:30 pm.

Corbin's Notes and Assignments:
(Meeting Notes & goals)
Today me (Corbin) and Kaiden got most of the SRS done and published the v1.1 release.
 
### Goals to complete before our next meeting

Porter if you can write the last prompt (assumptions and constraints) in the SRS that would be awesome. Also if you want to add anymore to the document its self you can.

Ethan can you look over the SRS and make sure it aligns properly with the projects goals. Also can you put the use case diagram together.

I will build a mock UML class diagram for the CLI MVP so we can get some discussion going about the design of our project and iron out any misunderstandings during our next meeting. I also put two features into the InProgress section of our github project to align with the MVP. You guys are also welcome to build class diagrams or change the InProgress features.

Lastly the next meeting will be Thursday around 4:30pm if that works for everybody?

We met together and implemented our MVP through a simple Command Line Interface (CLI).  Ethan and Corbin worked to get our main backend files created (orchestrator.py, cli.py).  Kaiden started types.py so that we can initialize our types for our classes, and Porter updated _get_existing_categories in orchestrator.py.  We also updated our UML diagram to include our new classes, namely CLI and Orchestrator.

And we created a use case diagram.
