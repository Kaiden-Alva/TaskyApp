Porter and Kaiden - we will be working on calendar integration over the next two weeks (Porter is backend and I am frontend)
Ethan - will be working on the updated class diagram for next week
Ethan and Corbin - tags, lists, and priority setting functionality - due in two weeks

Our current code is looking very clean and we don't want to modify it, but we will implement our design patterns for the new code that we create.
